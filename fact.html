	<blockquote><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  Youngsters' self-esteem can be significantly affected by comparing

	<blockquote><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Prolonged screen time resulting from mobile phone use can lead to digital eye strain,
	disrupted sleep patterns, and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, which collectively contribute to various health issues.<br>
         <strong>Advantages:</strong> In addition to providing access to health-related information and fitness apps, screens can
		 also facilitate remote health consultations and educational resources for maintaining well-being.<br>
        <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>  Excessive screen exposure can lead to eye discomfort, sleep disturbances, sedentary 
		lifestyle habits, and increased susceptibility to health risks such as obesity and cardiovascular problems.<br>
        <strong> Overcoming:</strong> To counter these negative effects, adopting the 20-20-20 rule (taking a 20-second break every 20 minutes of screen time), reducing screen
		exposure before bedtime, and actively engaging in physical activities can help maintain optimal health.</p></blockquote>
